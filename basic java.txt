WHAT IS JAVA ?

ANS-:  Java program is an object-oriented programming language,
 that means java is the collection of objects, and these objects communicate through 
method calls to each other to work together.

Class: The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). 
It can be defined as a logical template that share common properties and methods.

Example1: Blueprint of the house is class.
Example2: In real world, Alice is an object of the “Human” class.


2. Object: The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behavior and state.

Example: Dog, Cat, Monkey etc. are the object of “Animal” class.
Behavior: Running on the road.


3. Method: The behavior of an object is the method.

Example: The fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.


4. Instance variables: Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. 
The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

Example: Steps to compile and run a java program in a console


Java Keywords:-
---------------------

Keywords or Reserved words are the words in a language that are used for some internal process or represent some predefined actions.
These words are therefore not allowed to use as variable names or objects.

EX:-
abstract

assert

boolean

break

byte

case

catch

char

class

const

continue

default

do

double

else

enum

extends

final

finally

float  ect.


FIRST PROGRAM:-
-------------------------


public class first
{
	public static void  main(String[]args)
	{
		System.out.println("HELLO WORLD...");

	}

}

1.Class definition
This line uses the keyword class to declare that a new class is being defined. 

SYNTEX :
CLASS CLAASS_name{
}

2.main method: 
In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method.
The main function(method) is the entry point of your Java application, and it’s mandatory in a Java program. whose signature in Java is: 

public static void main(String[] args)

public: So that JVM can execute the method from anywhere.

static: The main method is to be called without an object. The modifiers public and static can be written in either order.

void: The main method doesn’t return anything.

main(): Name configured in the JVM. The main method must be inside the class definition. 
The compiler executes the codes starting always from the main function.

String[]: The main method accepts a single argument, an array of elements of type String.

System is a predefined class that provides access to the system, and out is the variable of type output stream connected to the console.


Data Types:-
----------------

Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable 
that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. 
Java has two categories in which data types are segregated 

Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double.

Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.


Primitive Data Types in Java

Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities.  There are 8 primitive data types.
int,char,float,dobule,byte,boolean,long,short..


Non-Primitive Data Type or Reference Data Types:-

The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable values because 
the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. 
They are strings, objects, arrays, etc. 



Primitive data type vs. Object data type:-



Java Identifiers:-
-----------------------

In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purposes.
 In Java, an identifier can be a class name, method name, variable name, or label. For

 example : 

public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 20;  // a is Identifiers

    }
}

Operators in Java:-
--------------------------

Operators in Java are the symbols used for performing specific operations in Java. 
Operators make tasks like addition, multiplication, etc 
which look easy although the implementation of these tasks is quite complex.


Types of Operators in Java
There are multiple types of operators in Java all are mentioned below:

Arithmetic Operators
Unary Operators
Assignment Operator
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Ternary Operator
Bitwise Operators
Shift Operators
instance of operator


Java Variables:-
---------------------

Variables are the data containers that save the data values during Java program execution. 
Every Variable in Java is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. 
A variable is a memory location name for the data.

TYPE OF VARIABLES:-

Local Variables.
Instance Variables.
Static Variables.


Scope of Variables In Java:-
-------------------------------------

variable use for  storing data in java. Variables in java can be used/accessed only for the scope within which they are declared and created.
 we call this feature as java scope.

its is three type of scope var.
class scope var.
block scope  var.
local scope var.

class scope  var :- it is create in class .that var. is use anywhere in a code that also called globbal var.

local scope var.:-
it is create in method and use only in method block.  it is store for short time .

block scope var.:-
 variable declared inside pair of brackets “{” and “}” in a method has scope within the brackets only.
EX:-
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        {
            
            int x = 10;
            System.out.println(x);
        }
        
        // System.out.println(x);
    }
}

Wrapper Classes :-
--------------------------

A Wrapper class in Java is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. 
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. 
In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object. 

Primitive Data Type         Wrapper Classes

 char                                    Character                              

byte                                     Byte

short                                   Short

int                                       Integer  

long                                    Long

float                                   Float

double                               Double

boolean                             Boolean



Autoboxing:-

In Autoboxing can we convert Primitive Data Types to object.

CODDE:-

public class WrapperExample1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
int a=20;  
Integer i=Integer.valueOf(a);      //converting int into Integer explicitly  
Integer j=a;         //autoboxing, now compiler will write Integer.valueOf(a) internally  
  
System.out.println(a+" "+i+" "+j);  
}}  

 Unboxing:-

In Unboxing can we convert object to primitive data type.


CODE:-
public class WrapperExample2{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
//Converting Integer to int    
Integer a=new Integer(3);    
int i=a.intValue();   //converting Integer to int explicitly  
int j=a;                  //unboxing, now compiler will write a.intValue() internally    
    
System.out.println(a+" "+i+" "+j);    
}}
