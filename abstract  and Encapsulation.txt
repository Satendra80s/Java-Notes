Java Does not support opertor overrriden and  overloading .

Java does not support construtor overrreding.

Java does support  constructor overlodinng.


abstract keyword in java:-
----------------------------------


abstract is a non-access modifier in java applicable for classes, and methods but not variables. It is used to achieve abstraction .


Q.  Abstract methods do not have a body:

 An abstract method is a method that does not have an implementation. 
It is declared using the abstract keyword and ends with a semicolon instead of a method body.


Q.  Abstract classes cannot be instantiated:

 An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is meant to be extended by other classes, 


Q. Abstract classes can have constructors:-
 
Abstract classes can have constructors, which are used to initialize instance variables and perform other initialization tasks. 
However, because abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly,

Q. Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods:-

Abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods. Concrete methods are implemented in 
the abstract class itself and can be used by both the abstract class and its subclasses.

Q. Abstract classes can implement interfaces:- 

Abstract classes can implement interfaces, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. 
In this case, the abstract class must provide concrete implementations of all methods defined in the interface.


Q.  can be define method  in interface ?


CODE:-

    abstract void printInfo();
}
 
// Child Class
class employee extends gfg {
    void printInfo()
    {
        String name = "aakanksha";
        int age = 21;
        float salary = 55552.2F;
 
        System.out.println(name);
        System.out.println(age);
        System.out.println(salary);
    }
}
 
// driver Class
class base {
    // main function
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // object created
        gfg s = new employee();
        s.printInfo();
    }
}



***NOTE:-
-------------

Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references, 
because Java’s approach to run-time polymorphism is implemented through the use of super-class references.
 Thus, it must be possible to create a reference to an abstract class so that it can be used to point to a subclass object.


you will never see a class or method declared with both final and abstract keywords. For classes, 
final is used to prevent inheritance whereas abstract classes depend upon their child classes for complete implementation. 
In cases of methods, final is used to prevent overriding whereas abstract methods need to be overridden in sub-classes.




What is Abstract class in Java?
Java abstract class is a class that can not be initiated by itself, it needs to be subclassed by another class to use its properties.
 An abstract class is declared using the “abstract” keyword in its class definition.


the following some important observations about abstract classes are as follows:

*An instance of an abstract class can not be created.

*Constructors are allowed.

*We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.

*There can be a final method in abstract class but any abstract method in class(abstract class) can not be declared as final  or 
in simpler terms final method can not be abstract itself as it will yield an error: “Illegal combination of modifiers: abstract and final”

*We can define static methods in an abstract class

*We can use the abstract keyword for declaring top-level classes (Outer class) as well as inner classes as abstract

*If a class contains at least one abstract method then compulsory should declare a class as abstract 

*If the Child class is unable to provide implementation to all abstract methods of the Parent class then we should declare that Child class as abstract 
So that the next level Child class should provide implementation to the remaining abstract method.



1. What is an abstract class in Java?
An abstract class in Java is a class that can not be initiated on its own but can be used as a subclass by another class.

2. What is the abstract class purpose?
The main purpose of the abstract class is to create a base class from which many other classes can be derived.

3. What is the main advantage of abstract class?
An abstract class provides the provides of data hiding in Java.

4. Why abstract class is faster than interface?
An abstract class is faster than an interface because the interface involves a search before calling any overridden method in Java whereas abstract class can be directly used. 


Control Abstraction in Java with Examples:-
-------------------------------------------------------------


In abstraction, there are two types: Data abstraction and Control abstraction.



Data abstraction, in short means creating complex data types but giving out only the essentials operations.

Control Abstraction: This refers to the software part of abstraction wherein the program is simplified and unnecessary execution details are removed.

Here are the main points about control abstraction:

* Control Abstraction follows the basic rule of DRY code which means Don’t Repeat Yourself and using functions in a program is the best example of control abstraction.


* Control Abstraction can be used to build new functionalities and combines control statements into a single unit.

* It is a fundamental feature of all higher-level languages and not just java.

* Higher-order functions, closures, and lambdas are few preconditions for control abstraction.

* Highlights more on how a particular functionality can be achieved rather than describing each detail.

* Forms the main unit of structured programming.

CODE:-
-------

abstract class Vehicle {

    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void VehicleSound();
   

    public void honk() 
{ System.out.println("honk honk"); }
}
 
// Subclass (inherit from Vehicle)
class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void VehicleSound()
    {
        // The body of VehicleSound() is provided here
        System.out.println("kon kon");
    }
}
 
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Create a Car object
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.VehicleSound();
        myCar.honk();
    }
}
