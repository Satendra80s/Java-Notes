Java Singleton Class:-
------------------------------

 singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
The primary purpose of a java Singleton class is to restrict the limit of the number of object creations to only one. 
This often ensures that there is access control to resources, for example, socket or database connection.


Inner Class in Java:-


In Java, inner class refers to the class that is declared inside class or interface which were mainly introduced, to sum up, 
same logically relatable classes as Java is purely object-oriented so bringing it closer to the real world.


Types of Inner Classes:

Nested Inner Class
Method Local Inner Classes
Static Nested Classes
Anonymous Inner Classes


Nested Inner Class:-

It can access any private instance variable of the outer class. Like any other instance variable, we can have access modifier private, protected, public, and default modifier. 

CODE:-

class Outer {

	class Inner {

		public void show()
		{

			// Print statement
			System.out.println("In a nested class method");
		}
	}
}
class Main {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Outer.Inner in = new Outer().new Inner();

		in.show();
	}
}
